# Java-Pokemon-Battle-Simulator
A Pokemon database configured to run a functioning Battle Simulator including most of the functionality seen in official Pokemon games.

Many special cases, moves, and forms were removed due to the hundreds of special interactions that would have to be implemented. This simulator demonstrates basic functionality, but still contains most of what a novice player would notice was missing. Every Pokemon, every move potentially learned by that Pokemon, and all the stats to go along.

Use the teambuilder function on Pokemon Showdown in order to create a template Pokemon. Reference the current teambuilder files for sample teams. Ensure directories in Data class are accurate to your local machine.

Screenshots of the simulator in screenshots folder.

Big thanks to veekun for the database--all of this wouldn't be possible without it.

Completed as a term project for CS 200 at the University of Northern Colorado by Erik Halenkamp.
