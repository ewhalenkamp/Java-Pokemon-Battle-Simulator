# Java-Pokemon-Battle-Simulator
A Pokemon database configured to run a functioning Battle Simulator including most of the functionality seen in official Pokemon games. Brawl with a 6 on 6 battle completely of your choosing. If it can be done in regular Pokemon, it can be done here!

Many special cases, moves, and forms were removed due to the hundreds of special interactions that would have to be implemented. This simulator demonstrates basic functionality, but still contains most of what a novice player would notice was missing. Every Pokemon, every move potentially learned by that Pokemon, its official artwork, and all its stats to go along.

Use the teambuilder function on Pokemon Showdown in order to create a template Pokemon. Reference the current teambuilder files for sample teams. Ensure directories in Data class are accurate to your local machine.

Big thanks to veekun for the database--all of this wouldn't be possible without it.

Completed as a Spring 2020 term project for CS 200 at the University of Northern Colorado by Erik Halenkamp.
